# Methods for the Bayesian estimation of free energies
**UNDER DEVELOPEMENT**

Repository to host tools for Bayesian estimate of free energies. 

## Bayesian adaptive mixture sampling (BAMS)
An online method to calculate the ratios of the normalizing constants in mixtures of distributions. The method is inspired by thinking of error estimates for free energies calculated with[Self Adjusted Mixture Sampling](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10618600.2015.1113975). The result is a method that is similar in flavour to the method by [Park, Ensign, and Pande](http://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.74.066703).

As this repository is still very much in flux, the tools in `bams/` can be used by adding `bams/` to your
`PYTHONPATH`.
